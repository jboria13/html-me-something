                <h2>3. Uncharted 4</h2>
                <p>5 years after our last adventure with Nathan Drake, developer Naughty Dog brought us back to that world for one last adventure in Uncharted 4. Uncharted 4 brings back classic characters from the series, Nathan Drake, his wife Elena, and grizzled mentor Sully. The series also introduces us to Drake&apos;s brother Sam. The crew goes on a wild adventure to locate Captain Henry Avery&apos;s long lost treasure. Naughty Dog continues to show why they are a world class developer by creating a game that pushed the Playstation 4 to it&apos;s graphic limits. </p>

                <h2>2. Bloodborne</h2>
                <p>Bloodborne is dark. It is gloomy It is punishing. One false move and the player will be ambushed by a swarm of horrific creatures, and lose all the recent experience they had worked so hard to gain. It is also an absolute blast to play and the feeling of accomplishment when you defeat a boss and make it back to the save point to level up is amazing. The weapon design and combat are truly first class. Developer From Software took a number of gameplay mechanics from the famous Dark Souls franchise and brought them into a beautifully dark Lovecraftian world.</p>

                <h2>1. Horizon Zero Dawn</h2>
                <p>Horizon Zero Dawn is an open world action game in a post-post-apocolytic world with Robot dinosaurs! Horizon does an excellent job of combining top notch story telling, gameplay, and graphics. Players in Horizon set off on an adventure to learn about the main character&apos;s origin. How fun does hunting down robot dinosaurs sound? It is better than that! Armed with an arsenal of mechanical bows and arrows, the game gives the play a number of unique ways to take down these mighty beasts. Graphically Horizon is the best looking game on the console. </p>
